# Pleiad

Pleiad is an ECS framework for 2D game development written in .NET 5 and up

## Goals

<p>Pleiad is designed for making 2D single-player games using ECS pattern.</p>
<p>This version will not be extended beyond 2 dimensions and will not have built-in tools for multiplayer.</p>

## Tools

Pleiad offers all the tools required for game development, such as:
- Entity Manager, for creating and deleting entities. It also manages addition, removal and manipulation of entity data components
- Systems to manipulate entity component data
- Input Manager tied to the active window for user input processing
- Rendering hooks, simplifying the process of putting models on the screen
- Tasks, an abstraction for multithreaded operations
- (WIP) Audio controller, to add, remove and modify sounds
